This is my portfolio website which showcases my projects, skills, certifications, experience and blogs. It is a fully static website, with an API endpoint to serve dynamic open graph images. The website is deployed on Oracle Cloud using Docker and GitLab CI.

## Technologies Used

- Astro.js - generates static site and Node.js server
- TailwindCSS - CSS framework for styling the website
- Markdown - content source (supports math and diagrams)
- D2 - generates technical diagrams during buildtime
- Satori - generates dynamic open graph images during runtime
- Docker - containerizes whole app using Node.js image
- Nginx - reverse proxy running on a Ubuntu virtual machine
- Cloudflare - provides DNS management, SSL encryption and caching  
- GitLab CI- builds Docker image and deploys it to Oracle Cloud
