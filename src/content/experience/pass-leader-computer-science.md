I heavily collaborated in a team of three peer mentors to design and deliver coding-based worksheets, with a focus on simplifying complex programming concepts to make them accessible for first-year students.

I regularly communicated with the course coordinator to review and refine worksheets, ensuring the materials aligned with course objectives and addressing student needs.
