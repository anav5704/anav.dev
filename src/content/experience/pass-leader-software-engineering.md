 I was honored with the Outstanding PASS Leader Award for my impact as a mentor. [Afshana Anzeg](https://www.linkedin.com/in/afshana-anzeg), my supervisor, once said, "When I walked into your session, I couldn’t tell who the leader was," reflecting on my leadership.
 
I introduced [Dub.co for QR codes](https://dub.co) into the PASS programme to solve the previous issue of QR codes expiring. This in turn streamlined access to online communities and increased course penetration for CS140 by ~50%.

I created [engaging and interactive worksheets](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zVIKlv8qi7oB6cjI_hCv8zUwDLMhLUxf?usp=drive_link), making use of resources like newsprint and markers. This fostered a collaborative environment and helped the students enjoy what is typically a boring theory course.
