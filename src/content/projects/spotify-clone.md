## Technologies Used

---

-   Next JS 13
-   TailwindCSS
-   Radix UI
-   Supabase
-   Zustand

## Getting Started

---

First fork and clone the repo. Then, run `npm install` to download all the dependencies. Now, set up your environmental variables. Make a `.env.local` file in the root of your project with the following variables(these are from your Supabase project):

```sh
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
```

Once that is done, run `npm run dev` to view it on localhost.
