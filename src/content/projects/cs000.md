## The Problem

---

Universities miss out on teaching one key concept in their computer science courses. The concept in question is version control. This issue is widespread in Universities in the South Pacific region. A survey of 40 students, 10 from each year level across BSE, BNS and CS/IS brings light to the problem. Data shows that _only_ 5% of the students have experience with version control.

## The Solution

---

CS000: Collaborative coding with Git and GitHub, aims to solve this issue by provding a simple and beginner-friendly introduction to version control. It does so while integrating concepts from firsst-year courses in hopes of making the topics in CS000 more relatable and easy to understand.
