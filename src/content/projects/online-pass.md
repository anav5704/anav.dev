## Architecture

---

![Architecture diagram](./images/online-pass-architecture.webp)

The PASS web app adopts a 3-layer MVC architecture, leveraging modern and open-source technologies. In the model layer, Prisma serves as the ORM for data management, interfacing with a PostgreSQL database hosted on AWS RDS, while AWS S3 handles object storage. React JS is utilized in the view layer for creating a dynamic user interface, with Next UI and Shadcn UI providing accessible and customizable components. For interconnection, Next JS acts as the framework, utilizing its built-in server to handle API functionalities, while Supabase serves as the real-time server, offering services such as web sockets for enhanced interactivity.

## Data Models

---

This schema outlines the structure of OPASS where every Course related model roots back up to the Member. The Member model was chosen to be the main entity as deleting it will delete every model that has a relationship to it in a cascading manner. This prevents there being any ghost entries laying in the database after a Member is removed from a Course. All in all, these models provide the foundation for a robust system supporting various educational and collaborative activities.
